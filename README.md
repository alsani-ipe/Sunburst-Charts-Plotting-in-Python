# Sunburst-Charts-Plotting-in-Python
Sunburst plots visualize hierarchical data spanning outwards radially from root to leaves. Similar to Icicle charts and Treemaps, the hierarchy is defined by labels (names for px.icicle) and parents attributes. The root starts from the center and children are added to the outer rings.

***What is Sunburst Chart?***

The sunburst diagram can be used to visualize the distribution of hierarchical variables of data. It represents distribution with a list of rings around the center circle. The central circle represents the total quantity of a particular attribute and then each ring around it represents distribution at that level to a relationship with parent ring which is inside of it.

The sunburst chart is also sometimes referred to as multi-level pie chart or ring chart or donut chart or doughnut chart or radial treemap.

***Common Application of Sunburst Chart***

A common example to explain the usage of a sunburst chart would population distribution of world where the central circle represents total world distribution, ring around it represents distribution per continent, ring around it represents distribution per country of each continent, and ring around it can further used to for distribution per state of each country.

It can be used to display any kind of hierarchical or multi-level data.

***Similarity to Treemap***

The sunburst chart is very similar to treemap charts with the only difference being that data is laid out radially. If you are interested in learning treemap plotting using python then feel free to go through our tutorial on treemap which explains various ways to draw treemap in python.
