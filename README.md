# Sunburst-Charts-Plotting-in-Python
Sunburst plots visualize hierarchical data spanning outwards radially from root to leaves. Similar to Icicle charts and Treemaps, the hierarchy is defined by labels (names for px.icicle) and parents attributes. The root starts from the center and children are added to the outer rings.
